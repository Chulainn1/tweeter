# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. This project was quite the learning experience for me. This simple app includes HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX. jQuery is a versitile JavaScript library which made HTML document manipulation and event handling stright-forward. AJAX enabled this web application to send and retrieve data asynchonously. 

Along side learning those technologies I was re-introduced to HTML and CSS. I have come to realize that both of these too, require my full attention. Specifcally, learning to use flexbox at the start took longer than expected.
